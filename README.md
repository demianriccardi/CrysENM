CrysENM
=======

Fortran 90 toolkit for application of elastic network models to proteins in the crystalline state. 
I wrote this as a NLM postdoctoral trainee in the laboratory of George N. Phillips, Jr.  It is in need of some TLC 
(not TLS, wink).  TODO: Refactor, write testing framework, remove compiler dependencies.  

Dependencies: 
1. intel fortran compiler: uses MKL libraries for hefty matrix diagonalization
2. ARPACK: http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/
3. CrysFML
