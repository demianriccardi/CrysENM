CrysENM
=======

Fortran 90 toolkit for application of elastic network models to proteins in the crystalline state. 
I wrote this as a NLM postdoctoral trainee in the laboratory of George N. Phillips, Jr from 2007-2010.  
It is in need of some TLC (not TLS, wink).  TODO: Refactor, reduce, write testing framework, remove compiler dependencies, 
expand.  

Dependencies: 

1. intel fortran compiler: uses MKL libraries for hefty matrix diagonalization

2. ARPACK: http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/

3. CrysFML

It will work, but you have to know what you're doing!

I will push programs that use the library as I clean them up.  Contact me if you are interested!  A contact got me this far!
