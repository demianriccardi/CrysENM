CrysENM
=======

Fortran 90 toolkit for application of elastic network models to proteins in the crystalline state. 
I wrote this as a NLM postdoctoral trainee in the laboratory of George N. Phillips, Jr from 2007-2010.  

TODO:  Write testing framework, Refactor, DOCUMENT.  

Dependencies: 


1. ARPACK:   http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/
2. CrysFML:  http://www.ill.eu/other_sites/fullprof/php/programs24b7.html?pagina=Crysfml
3. Lapack95: http://www.netlib.org/lapack95/

I will push programs that use the library as I clean them up.  Contact me if you are interested!  
A contact got me this far!
